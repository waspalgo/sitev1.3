    "q1": {
      "question": "Do you manage my money?",
      "answer": "No. WASPALGO never touches your money. Your capital remains 100% in your own account. The algorithm only sends automated signals, and it's your account that executes positions. You maintain total control, at all times."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Can I withdraw my capital at any time?",
      "answer": "Yes, of course. You are free to withdraw or deposit whenever you want, without fees and without delay. WA-AMIR does not block any funds: everything is managed directly from the broker."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What are the risks?",
      "answer": "As with any investment in financial markets, there is always a risk of loss. However, WA-AMIR is designed to: continuously analyze the market, detect trends and reversals, limit excessive exposure, secure positions according to market conditions. The algorithm also receives macroeconomic alerts in case of announcements likely to impact the market (FOMC, NFP, CPI…), which allows it to adapt its strategy."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How does the WA-AMIR engine make decisions?",
      "answer": "WA-AMIR uses a combination of technical analysis, statistical models, and real-time data. It automatically identifies: favorable zones, reversals, entry and exit signals, volatility periods. Its goal: execute logical, consistent, and emotion-free decisions."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What platforms are compatible?",
      "answer": "WA-AMIR currently works via Pu Prime, which serves as a secure intermediary. Then, it is possible to connect MetaTrader 4 or 5 to Pu Prime, which allows: tracking all positions in real-time, consulting the complete history, checking activity directly from MetaTrader."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "How much does access to the algorithm cost?",
      "answer": "Access to WA-AMIR is 100% free. No subscription, no initial payment. WASPALGO only takes 10% of the profits you make each month. If you don't make any profits during the month, you don't pay anything."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Can I stop WA-AMIR whenever I want?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can disable the algorithm with one click. All positions remain visible and controllable from MetaTrader or Pu Prime."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "What capital is recommended to start?",
      "answer": "Technically, you can start with the minimum capital required by your broker. However, for an optimal experience, we recommend a minimum capital of $600."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "Does the algorithm work 24/7?",
      "answer": "WA-AMIR works continuously during market opening (5 days out of 7). It continuously analyzes XAUUSD to seize the best opportunities as soon as they appear."
    },
    "q10": {
      "question": "What returns can I expect?",
      "answer": "Returns vary according to: market conditions, volatility, economic periods. We display a real and transparent history, but no performance is guaranteed."
    },
    "q11": {
      "question": "Can the algorithm lose money?",
      "answer": "Yes. All strategies involve risks. WA-AMIR can experience losses, but it is designed to: limit drawdowns, optimize risk management, aim for stable performance over the long term."
